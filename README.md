## How to Use

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the website.

- **Navigation:** Use the top menu links to navigate. On smaller screens, click the hamburger icon to toggle the mobile menu.  
- **Buttons:** All buttons (e.g., "Start an Order," "Sign Up Today") are visual and for demonstration only—they do not perform any real actions.  
- **Scrolling:** Scroll down to explore promotional sections, seasonal offers, and membership perks.  
- **Footer:** Browse company info, career hub, social media links, and privacy/legal information.

No installation or backend is required, as this is a static mock website.
